1. Initialize pthread arrays for Producers and Consumers 
(their length's such be the user inputted items for Producers and the calculated length of items for Consumers)
2. Create these pthreads, each calling their respective function Produce and Consume. First create the pthreads for Producers then create the pthreads for Consumers.
3. In the Producer function, use a bounded buffer to load items and pthread synchronization to produce the appropriate amount of items for that thread
4. In the Consumer function, use a bounded buffer and wait for it empty. then use pthread synchronization to produce the appropriate amount of items for that thread.
5. Join the threads.
6. Compare the arrays to see if the items produced for Pthreads of Producers and Consumers are identical.
